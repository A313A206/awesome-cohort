# Activity

We're going to work with making changes, but your teams are going to decide on branching and merging policies.

## Repo setup
1. Appoint someone as the repo owner for your team
1. That person should create a repo on GitHub:  
  `EICPCohort5/[teamname]-repo`
1. Create the repo with a README file
1. The repo owner should *clone* the repo
1. The repo owner should update `README.md`
1. The repo owner should push the update from local to remote.

## Changes
You will need to manage two sets of changes:  

1. Team members adding individual files
1. Team members editing the same file.

Discuss whether you want to use the cloned pull request style or the 
forked pull request style

## Adding files
1. Team members should create their own *local* branch to work with. 
1. On those branches, each team member should create a file describing themselves.  
(For example, I would create `john-paxton.md` and add my name, city, and state.)
1. The team members should commit their individual files to their branches. 

The end goal is to have a repo with each team member's file present. How you get there is up to you. 


## Merging one file

One more task. Now everyone should edit `README.md` and add text and a link to each of their individual files. Note that in a Markdown file, you can create a link like this:
```markdown
[link text](link url)
[TJX](https://tjx.com)
```

Again, the goal is that `[teamname]-repo` has an updated README file with everyone's contributions present. 

When your team is done, return to the main meeting.
